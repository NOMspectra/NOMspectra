# nhsmass

nhsmass is an open-access Python package for processing high resolution mass spectra, priviosly for analysis dissolve organic matter, humic samples and other difficult object by FTICR or Orbitrap technique. 

Main operation:

- Assigning brutto formulas to signal by mass with desirable ranges of elements (include isotopes)
- Recallibrate spectrum by etalon, asssigment error or dif-mass map
- Working with spectra as with sets (intersection, union, etc)
- Plot spectrum and different kind of Van Krevelen diagramm
- Calculate simmilarity metrics and moleculars descriptors for spectra
- and many other usefull calculation

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.8

By pip:

```console
pip install nhsmass
```
